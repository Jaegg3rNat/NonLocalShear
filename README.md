# Shear and Environmental Flow

This project is a numerical integration of partial differential equations (PDEs) using a pseudospectral approach and the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method. The code is part of the research for the paper
**_Flow spatial structure determines pattern instabilities in nonlocal models of population dynamics._**
Published in *Communication Physics*.

## Project Structure

- `Vegetation/Codes/_NonLocal_FC.py`: Contains the implementation of the vegetation model.
- `Logistic/Codes/LogisticV1.py`: Contains the implementation of the logistic model.
- `Swift_Hohenberg/Codes/Run_Flow_Integration.py`: Contains the implementation of the Swift-Hohenberg model.

## Requirements

The following packages are necessary to run the code:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scipy`: For scientific computations, mainly FFT.
- `sympy`: For symbolic mathematics.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting results.
- `h5py`: For handling HDF5 files.
- `tqdm`: For displaying progress bars.
- `numba`: For JIT compilation to speed up the code.

It is also required to have a Python version >= 3.6.

## Installation

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib h5py tqdm numba
```

## Usage

To run the code, navigate to the directory containing the scripts and execute them using Python:
Each script should be run individually and they have input parameters:
- LogisticV1.py:
  - mu: is the Damkholer number (growth rate)
  - pe: is the Peclet number (advection rate)
  - flowtype: Stationary flow choosen to apply
    - sinusoidal, rankine, parabolic, cellular, point vortex, constant


- _NonLocal_FC.py:
  - mu: decay ratio
  - delta: enhancing constants difference ($\chi_f - \chi_c$)
  - flowtype:
    - sinusoidal, rankine, parabolic, cellular, point vortex, constant
  - pe: is the Peclet number (advection rate)
    
```bash
python Vegetation/Codes/_NonLocal_FC.py mu delta flowtype pe
python Logistic/Codes/LogisticV1.py mu pe flowtype
```

## Description

### Generating Figures

The base output of the code without any modification is a figure showing the Spatial Pattern Distribution.
This figure is refreshed every 2000 time steps.

Like the example below:

<img src="Vegetation/Figures/fig  0.png" alt="Example Output" width="600"/>

If you want to save the data, you should uncomment the final lines of the code and choose if you want to save the field distribution or only the Density time series.

The left side shows the spatial distribution, while the right side shows the Integral of Density /L^2 x Time plot


This is the basis output for both Vegetation and Logistic models.

In case you want to save the data, you can uncomment the last lines of the code and choose whether to save the field distribution or only the density time series.

### _NonLocal_FC.py

This script performs the numerical integration of Eqs. 2.16 of the paper, using a pseudospectral approach and RK4.
Is the unnormalized version of the vegetation model. 

Therefore the `mu` parameter is defined from (0,1). `mu > 1` is not defined.

`delta` is the $\lambda$ parameter defined in the paper.

`pe` in this model is not the Peclet number, but the advection rate (or flow intensisty $v_0$).

- Initialization of parameters and variables.
- Definition of the equilibrium solution using symbolic mathematics.
- Time-stepping loop to update the solution using the RK4 method.
- Saving results and plotting the configuration at specified intervals.


### LogisticV1.py

This script implements the logistic model for the given problem. It includes:

This script runs the unnormalized version of the nonlocal logistic model. However it uses as input the normalize parameters defined in the paper.

`mu` is the Damkholer number (normalized growth rate) defined in the paper.
`pe` is the Peclet number (normalized advection rate).

That means:

  input : `mu` is  $$\mu = \frac{\alpha R^2}{D}$$
  input : `pe` is  $$Pe = \frac{v_0 R^2}{D}$$


- Initialization of parameters and variables.
- Definition of the logistic equation.
- Numerical integration using the RK4 method.
- Saving results and plotting the configuration at specified intervals.
